## Components and Props:

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object. We call this object "props".
##  React Life Cycle methods. 
Lifecycle methods are special methods each component can have that allow us to hook into the views when specific conditions happen (i.e. when the component first renders or when the component gets updated with new data, etc).
You can really break Reactâ€™s Life Cycle Methods down into two categories.

When a component get mounted to the DOM and unmounted.
When a component receives new data.
